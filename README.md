# student-score-predictor
A simple ML project to predict student scores based on study hours.

## Project Description
This is a beginner-level project using Linear Regression to predict marks based on the number of study hours. I created a simple dataset and trained the model using Python libraries.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries: pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
2. Run the Python file.

## Dataset
Sample data used:
- Hours: [1, 2, 3, 4.5, 5, 6.1, 7.2, 8.5, 9.6, 10]
- Scores: [10, 20, 30, 41, 49, 60, 69, 81, 90, 95]
